 |   Assignment:  Program #1
 |       Author:  Emily Foley [emfoley@arizona.edu]
 |
 |       Course:  CSC 345, Analysis of Discrete Structures, Fall 2025
 |   Instructor:  L. McCann
 | Sect. Leader:  [Your Section Leader's name]
 |     Due Date:  9/18/25, at the beginning of class
 |
 |     Language:  [Java (VSCode, JDK 21)]
 |     Packages:  None
 |  Compile/Run:  To compile, type javac *.java to compile all the class files
 |                together. To run Encrypt.java, type java Encrypt <deckFile> 
 |                <messageFile>, where <messageFile> contains the message to 
 |                be encrypted. To run Decrypt.java, use the same command but 
 |                replace messageFile with the name of the file containing the 
 |                encrypted message (the Encrypt class uses the file name 
 |                encryptedMessage.txt).
 +-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 |
 |  Description:  [Describe the program's goal, IN DETAIL.]
 |                
 |        Input:  One .dat file containing an initial permutation of deck cards
 |                , one .txt file containing the message to be encrypted.
 |               
 |
 |       Output:  [Describe the output that the user should expect the
 |                 program to produce.]
 |
 |   Techniques:  [Names of standard algorithms employed, explanations
 |                 of why things were done they way they were done, etc.
 |                 This is the place for technical information that another
 |                 programmer would like to know.]
 |
 |   Required Features Not Included:
 |                [If the assignment specifies a feature that you were
 |                 unable to include in the program, mention that omission
 |                 here.  Otherwise, state that you were able to include
 |                 all of the required features in your program.]
 |
 |   Known Bugs:  [If you know of any problems with the code, provide
 |                details here, otherwise clearly state that you know
 |                of know logic errors.]
